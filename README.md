# 🏠 House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

This project is part of **Task 1** for my **Machine Learning Virtual Internship at Skillcraft Technology**.

The objective of this task was to implement a **Linear Regression model** in Python to predict the prices of houses based on:
- 📏 Square Footage (area)
- 🛏️ Number of Bedrooms
- 🛁 Number of Bathrooms

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how machine learning techniques can be used to predict house prices using **scikit-learn**'s Linear Regression model.

### 🔍 Problem Statement
> "Implement a linear regression model to predict the prices of houses based on their square footage and the number of bedrooms and bathrooms."

### 🧠 Task 02 – Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering

This project is a part of my **Machine Learning Internship at Skillcraft Technology**.  
The goal of this task is to implement a **K-Means Clustering algorithm** to group customers of a retail store based on their **purchase history**.

---

## 📌 Objective

To analyze and segment customers into different groups using their **Annual Income** and **Spending Score**, helping businesses better understand customer behavior and target them effectively.

---

## 📊 Dataset

For this project, we use a synthetic or commonly used dataset like the **Mall Customer Segmentation Data**, which includes:

- Customer ID  
- Gender  
- Age  
- Annual Income (k$)  
- Spending Score (1–100)  

If no dataset is provided, you can generate or simulate similar data manually using pandas.

---

## 📌 Technologies Used

- Python 🐍  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- scikit-learn (for KMeans)

---

## 🔧 How it works (Step-by-Step)

1. **Import Libraries**  
2. **Load Data** (manual or from CSV)  
3. **Preprocess & Select Features**  
4. **Use Elbow Method** to find optimal number of clusters  
5. **Apply KMeans Algorithm**  
6. **Visualize Clusters using Scatter Plot**  
7. **Label & Analyze Results**

---

## 📈 Output

- Each customer is assigned a **cluster label** (e.g., 0, 1, 2)
- Visualization showing clusters with different colors for:
  - High Income + High Spend
  - Low Income + High Spend
  - Low Income + Low Spend, etc.

---

## 🧠 What I Learned

- Understanding of **Unsupervised Learning**
- How **KMeans Clustering** works
- Importance of **data scaling and visualization**
- Real-world use cases of customer segmentation
- Hands-on experience in **Python and ML libraries**
