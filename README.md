# 🏠 House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

This project is part of **Task 1** for my **Machine Learning Virtual Internship at Skillcraft Technology**.

The objective of this task was to implement a **Linear Regression model** in Python to predict the prices of houses based on:
- 📏 Square Footage (area)
- 🛏️ Number of Bedrooms
- 🛁 Number of Bathrooms
